            <p>LED strip lights are available in various shades of whites or colors. Generally, white light is the most
                useful and
                popular option for indoor lighting applications.

                In describing the different shades and qualities of white, color temperature (CCT) and color rendering
                index (CRI) are
                two metrics that are important to keep in mind.

                Color temperature is a measure of how "warm" or "cool" the light's color appears. The soft glow of a
                traditional
                incandescent bulb has a low color temperature (2700K), while the crisp, bright white of natural daylight
                has a high
                color temperature (6500K).

                Color rendering is a measure of how accurate colors appear under the light source. Under a low CRI LED
                strip, colors
                might appear distorted, washed out, or indistinguishable. High CRI LED products offer light that allows
                objects to
                appear the way they would under an ideal light source such as a halogen lamp, or natural daylight. Also
                look for a light
                source's R9 value, which provides further information about how red colors are rendered.

                Need help deciding which color temperature to choose? See our tutorial here.

            <h2 id="article4">Aluminium channels & heatsinking</h2>
            <p>
                Despite their versatility and ease of use, LED strips are nonetheless bare circuitboard components.
                Mounting
                the LED
                strips inside of an aluminum channel, along with a diffuser cover, can significantly improve the
                aesthetics
                of a
                lighting installation.

                Aluminum channels are typically long pieces of extruded aluminum in a U or V shape. The LED strip is
                them
                placed and
                secured (using the double sided tape) at the bottom of the channel. A long piece of frosted
                polycarbonate
                plastic
                (typically provided with the aluminum channel) then snaps onto the top of the aluminum channel.

                You may have correctly read elsewhere that LEDs need effective thermal management for reliable
                operation.
                Higher quality
                LED strip light products actually underdrive the LEDs, and are designed to last tens of thousands of
                hours
                without any
                heatsinking. During operation, the LED strip can get warm to the touch, but the temperature rise is far
                below the
                thermal limits of the LEDs and circuitboard components. (Our products typically exhibit temperature
                rises of
                55 F or 30
                C over ambient temperatures, without any heatsinking).

                The aluminum channels may help dissipate the heat from the LED strips, but for the most part they are
                not
                necessary for
                thermal management and are primarily for mounting and diffusion purposes.
